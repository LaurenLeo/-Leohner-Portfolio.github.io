<h3>Meet Lauren Leohner</h3>
  <p>Lauren Leohner is a multifaceted designer.</p>
      <h4>Her design background includes:</h4>
      <ol class="artlist">
        <li>oil painting</li>
	      <li>jewelry-making/metalsmith</li>
	      <li>fiber arts</li>
	      <li>ceramics</li>
	      <li>culinary arts</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="one">After studying at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in Oil Painting,
        Lauren became a self-driven jeweler and metalsmith. Starting this journey with
        only three college courses on the subject, she supplemented her education at
        Parkland College in Illinois and New Approach School in Tennessee. In the past
        six years, she has sold her work online and at art/craft shows around the Midwest.
        In addition  to working with the fine and craft art mediums, Lauren has worked in
        bakeries and kitchens.</p>
      <p class="two">
        Working with e-commerce sites like Etsy and Shopify, have introduced
        Lauren to front-end web development as another outlet of design expression
         and communication. Currently she is enrolled at Grand Circus Coding Bootcamp
          in Detroit, MI to become a fully trained front-end developer.</p>

      <p>Taken from Susan Stamburg's NPR article <cite>You Gonna Finish That? What We Can Learn From
        Artworks in Progress:</cite></p>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.npr.org/2016/05/31/479584758/you-gonna-finish-that-what-we-can-learn-from-artworks-in-progress">
        <p>Rembrandt was once asked why so many of his works look half-finished.
          He replied: "A work of art is complete when in it the artist has realized
          his intention." Rembrandt implies that it's up to the artist to decide,
          not to critics, who may say a work appears raw, lacking a complete appearance.</p>
